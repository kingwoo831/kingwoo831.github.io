        <h1>Sex education and Young pregnant</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ph>Sexual Education in Hong Kong is available starts in primary school. However,
            the guideline on sexual education has been criticised for being out of
            date. According to the Hong Kong government, the guideline on sexual education
            is last updated in 1997. The key concept covered five elements such as
            human development, health and behaviour, interpersonal relationships; and
            marriage and family. The effectiveness of sexual education has been doubted
            by the government as there is a surge in HIV infection from 181 in 1997
            to 692 in 2016, according to the Department of Health. At the same time,
            there is a surge in young pregnancy and young pregnancy of unmarried couples
            from 2011 - 2016 amongst 18 to 27 years old, according to the family association
            of Hong Kong. Due to these two phenomenon of the ineffectiveness of sexual
            education and the rise of young pregnancy, our study raised the question
            of whether there is a direct link between them.

            <p="">It lacks images, but at least it has style. And it has links, even if
            they don't go anywhereâ€¦

            <p>There should be more here, but I don't know what yet.
